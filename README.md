This repository contains the code and resources for an AI-enabled car parking system using OpenCV. The system leverages computer vision techniques to detect and monitor car parking spaces in real-time. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for setting up the environment, and a guide on how to use the system.

Introduction
The AI-Enabled Car Parking System is designed to automate the process of detecting vacant and occupied parking spaces. Using OpenCV, the system processes video feeds from surveillance cameras, identifies parking spaces, and determines their occupancy status in real-time. This can be particularly useful for smart parking solutions in urban areas, shopping malls, and other facilities with parking lots.

Features
Real-time Detection: Continuously monitors parking spaces and updates their status.
OpenCV Integration: Utilizes OpenCV for image processing and computer vision tasks.
Scalability: Can be adapted to different parking lot layouts and sizes.
Visual Output: Displays the parking lot with marked parking spaces and their status (occupied or vacant).
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
OpenCV 4.5 or higher
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualizing results)
Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt
Steps
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-enabled-car-parking.git
cd ai-enabled-car-parking
Create a Virtual Environment

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare the Video Feed

Ensure you have a video feed or a recorded video file of the parking lot.

Configure Parking Space Coordinates

Modify the config/parking_spaces.json file to include the coordinates of the parking spaces in your video feed.

Run the System

bash
Copy code
python main.py --video path_to_your_video.mp4
The system will process the video feed and display the parking lot with the status of each parking space.
